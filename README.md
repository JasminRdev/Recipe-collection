# Recipe-collection
Here are my Recipes collected. You can filter through and add new ones. But currently it is based on my local db. Just an website to practice my coding skills in general and share on of my favourite hobby.

currently the frontend is written with html, css, js and ejs templating.
-navigate to backend folder
-execute npm start to start the server
-go to http://localhost:3000/

in future this website will have multipe different frontent languages able to choose. They will be not different in the look.
